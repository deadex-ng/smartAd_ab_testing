# smartAd_ab_testing

SmartAd is a mobile first advertiser agency. It designs intuitive touch-enabled advertising.
SmartAd provides an additional service called Brand Impact Optimiser (BIO), 
a lightweight questionnaire, served with every campaign to determine the impact of the creative, 
the ad they design, on various upper funnel metrics, including memorability and brand sentiment. 

Challenge:
To design a reliable hypothesis testing algorithm for the BIO service and to determine 
whether a recent advertising campaign resulted in a significant lift in brand awareness.

Solution:
The solution uses classical A/B testing algorithm. It also uses a z-test for 
hypothesis testing. This is beacuse of the central limit theorem.
